##Semester Project 1

###Description:

I created an engaging website for the Community Science Museum, tailored for kids and families. The project challenged me to design a user-friendly site, incorporating provided assets creatively. My final product consisted of 5 pages, prioritizing easy navigation and quick loading times. I focused on clean HTML and CSS, ensuring neat code organization and fast loading by optimizing image sizes. Adhering to WCAG principles, I prioritized accessibility, making sure the site was easy to use for all visitors. Additionally, I integrated SEO best practices to enhance discoverability. This project showcased my technical skills in web development and commitment to user-centric design.
